open(...): This opens a file named table_<n>.txt in write mode ("w").
as f: This assigns the opened file to the variable f, so you can use f to write to the file.
f.write(table): This writes the multiplication table string (table) to the file.
Why use with?
When you use with:

You don’t have to manually close the file (e.g., using f.close()).
Python automatically handles the cleanup (closing the file) for you, even if there’s an error in the code.
So, in simple terms:

The with statement makes your file-writing code cleaner and safer.
It automatically takes care of closing the file after writing to it.
