print(""""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" is a nursery rhyme with the following lyrics: 
"Twinkle, twinkle, little star"
"How I wonder what you are"
"Up above the world so high"
"Like a diamond in the sky"

"When he nothing shines upon"
"Then you show your little light"
"Twinkle, twinkle, all the night"
