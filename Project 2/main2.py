'''Enhanced Features
Input Validation:
Ensures the user enters a number within the valid range (1â€“100).
Attempt Limit:
Limits the number of attempts to 10. If the user exceeds the limit, the game ends.
Difficulty Levels:
Allows the user to choose difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), which affect the range of the random number and the number of allowed attempts.
Replay Option:
After a game ends, the user can choose to play again.'''

# strip() ensures no accidental spaces before or after the input affect the response.
# lower() makes the input case-insensitive, so users can type "YES", "yes", "yEs", etc., and it will all be treated as "yes".
