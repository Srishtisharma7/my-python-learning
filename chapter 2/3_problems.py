""" Problems:
1.Use comparison operatol to find out whether a given variable a is greater than 'b'
or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80
2. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.
3. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

#solution 1
a = int(input ("Enter number 1: "))
b = int(input("Enter number 2: "))
print("a is greater than b is ", a>b) #34>80 return false;
print("The average of these two number is", (a+b)/2)            #solution 2
print ("The square of the number is", a**2)                     #solution 3

#in python for power we dont use a^2 rather use a**2 or a**30 ie; a raised to the power of 30
# or for square of number a*a
